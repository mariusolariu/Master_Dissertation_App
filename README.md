# Master_Dissertation_App
Android app that digitizes the work of YMCA Paisley, a volunteering organization that equips young persons with STEM knowledge so that they are ready for their future careers and make a positive impact in the world. I volunteered for this organisation for 1 year while studying for my MSc degree in Glasgow, UK.
